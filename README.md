# Library-Sensor
This is a repository for creating a sensor for my mom's library.

My mom wanted a sensor that sits inside of something and says hello and good bye as people enter and exit her library.  This is the repository I used to transfer the information from one raspberrypi to the other.  

While testing I used royalty free downloaded sound files (analog-watch-alarm_daniel-simion.wav and fire-truck-air-horn_daniel-simion.wav) from soundbible.com set to only play for 1 second, but any .wav file can be used for the sounds, just ensure that you change the play time accordingly.
